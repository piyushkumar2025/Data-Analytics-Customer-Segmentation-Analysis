# Data-Analytics-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
In this project, I implemented an RFM model to segment customers and assessed data quality rigorously. Using Python, we conducted EDA for insightful patterns. Additionally, a Tableau Dashboard was created to provide a user-friendly interface for stakeholders, enabling effective decision-making based on customer behavior insights.
